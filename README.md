# PA2-ECE2112
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for my Python codes for Programming Assignment 2. <br>
Submission Deadline: September 5, 2024; 2:30 pm <br>
This assignment is for the subject ECE2112 - Advanced Computer Programming and Algorithms.

The notebook contains the Python codes for the two given problems in Experiment 2: Numerical Python (NumPy). 
As the name suggests, the codes for both problems will utilize the Numerical Python (NumPy) library. This is to help me familiarize the various functions and features of this library that may help me become a better Python programmer.

These are the contents of the Jupyter Notebook:
1. Normalization problem - this aims to simplify a random data set into one that avoids redundancy and takes up less disk space. 
2. Divisible by 3 problem - this problem tackles finding particular numbers in a given data set (in this case, a 10 x 10 matrix of perfect square numbers) that meet certain criteria.
